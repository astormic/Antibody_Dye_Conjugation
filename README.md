## Materials:
  - Primary Antibody:
    [Mouse anti-Human CD45 (HI30)](https://www.ptglab.com/products/CD45-Antibody-65109-1-Ig.htm)
  - Secondary Antibody:
    [Goat anti-Mouse IgG](https://www.bioscience.co.uk/product~73025)
  - Dye:
    [Atto 647N](https://www.aatbio.com/products/atto-647n-nhs-ester) supplied with an NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimde) ester reactive group.
  - Phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
  - Sodium bicarbonate (SoBi), 1M, pH8.5

## Methods:
### Buffer Exchange in Gel Filteration Column
1. Take an aliquot of protein
2. A quick spin
3. Spin for 2min (1000)
4. Run PBS 4 times (500 µL) and spin 4min (1000)
5. Run the protein through
6. Take the protein from the collection tube

### Bioconjugation for primary CD45
1. Add 2 µL of SoBi to the proteins and mix them
2. Add 2 µL of dye to the mixture
3. Take 1.5 µL of the buffer to measure the concentration using UV-Vis
4. Leave it at room temperature (1 hour)
5. Run the buffer through a new gel filteration column

### Bioconjugation for secondary
1. Add 5 µL of SoBi to the proteins and mix them
2. Add 6 µL of dye to the mixture
3. Take 1.5 µL of the buffer to measure the concentration using UV-Vis
4. Leave it at room temperature (1 hour)
5. Run the buffer through a new gel filteration column
   
## FAQs: 
**Why do we use sodium bicarbonate?**

A sodium bicarbonate (SoBi) buffer provides the optimal pH for the NHS ester of the dye to react efficiently with the antibody.

**Why do we exchange the buffer in gel filteration column?**

To be able to filter the sodium azide in protein solution.
